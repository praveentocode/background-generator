	SCENARIO WHERE MERGE CONFLICT CAN OCCUR:
		When 2 developers work on the same changes.
		
		1. Developer A already created a Pull request for his branch and waiting for review and merge request from Developer B.
		2. Developer B has made a change on the same line as of Developer A. Now, Developer B accepts the Pull request of Developer A without
		realizing the same line change and merges into the master. 
		3. Now Developer B merges the master with his branch which has the changes on the same line. Now the conflict occurs.		
		4. If there are conflicts, in the file, <<<<<HEAD and >>>>>master will be displayed. If we want to have those merge changes, 
		we can delete HEAD/master and commit those changes.
